# RDPIT - Is an active reconnaissance tool for penetration testers and security researchers.
# Designed by Fixitgearware Security Cybersecurity Team.
# This tool is able to ping assets of any kinds, size to determine if they are active or not.
# It also has a DNS record information gathering module, enabling users to gather DNS records of domains or IPs.

#------Code Description Section------#
# This file contains the code for resolving domain names to IP addresses.
# returning the IP if the input or file contains a domain name.
# and returns hostname for IP addresses if the input or file contains an IP address.
# This is to enable the DNS-RECORD-TOOL to fetch and display DNS records
